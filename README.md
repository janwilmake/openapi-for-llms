Context:

TODO:

- ✅ use oapis.org as cli instead and add that as script
- ✅ generate separate file per tag
- ✅ generate separate file per operation
- ✅ Generate `llms.txt` showing SLOP-like thing the summary for each operation and the description of the openapi and for each tag
- ✅ Add ability to fetch in the external docs urls, assuming it returns markdown.
- Generate README from the `llms.txt` that adds links to prompt it and to get operation or tag on uithub (separate package `llms-txt-to-readme`)

Worth a post, great way to introduce parallel to my audience.
